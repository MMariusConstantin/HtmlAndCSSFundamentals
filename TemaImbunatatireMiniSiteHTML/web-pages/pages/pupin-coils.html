        <p>Pupin's 1899 patent for <i>loading coils</i>, archaically called <i>"Pupin coils"</i>, followed closely on
            the pioneering work of the English physicist and mathematician <i>Oliver Heaviside</i>, which predates Pupin's
            patent by some seven years. The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it
            were acquired by American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's
            patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their own development in hand led by <i>George
            Campbell</i> and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were
            afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly
            extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>
